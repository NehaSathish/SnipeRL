Objective:
Create a stock recommendation algorithm to predict the next best stock in the next time period.


Key Tasks:
- Creating a script to scrape the OHLCV(Open High Low Close Data) for the required time periods.
- Picking bucket of stocks based on budget/performance.
- Applying Reinforcement Learning techniques on 5 year historical data and comparing various algorithms to find the best performing algorithm.
- Applying the same algorithm on blockchain markets.

Outcome:
- The algorithm entered trades at sniper entry points(lowest of low points).
- The algorithm provided 900% returns on investment based on 5 year historical data.
- Suitable to blockchain markets.
- Suitable to novice investors.
